		<h1>Basic Git for Localizers</h1>

		<h2>Fork a repository</h2>
		<p>If you don’t have an account on GitHub, register one for free on <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a> and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-all">install git</a> on your system.</p>
		<p>Once you login, go to the repository you’re interested in and create a "fork".
		Let’s say you want to create a fork of <kbd>webpay</kbd>: go to <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/webpay">github.com/mozilla/webpay</a> and click on the <strong>Fork</strong> button in the top right part of the page.<img src="img/git1.png" alt="fork" title="Fork the repository" /></p>
		<p>This will create a fork – think of it as a copy – of the <kbd>webpay</kbd> repository in your own account. At this point your fork and the original repository share the same history, but will live separate lives from this moment on.</p>
        <img src="img/repo1.png" alt="Fork and Original Repo" title="Two repositories, same history" />

		<h2>Clone your forked repository</h2>
		<p>Now you have to clone the repository on your computer. Suppose that your username is <kbd>l10nguy</kbd>, you need to clone <a href="https://github.com/l10nguy/webpay">https://github.com/l10nguy/webpay</a> and tell the system that you want to use the original Mozilla repository as a source for updates.</p>
        <p>These are the commands you need to run in your terminal (move into the folder where you want to keep your files before running them):</p>
		<pre>
# You’re cloning your forked repository, so github.com/YOURUSER/REPOSITORY
git clone https://github.com/l10nguy/webpay

# Move in the clone’s folder created by the previous command
cd webpay

# You’re telling Git to use another repository as a source.
# So not YOURUSER but MOZILLA in this case (owner of the original repository)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mozilla/webpay</pre>

		<h2>Update your forked repository</h2>
		<p>Now you have a local copy of your fork inside the folder <kbd>webpay</kbd>. Remember: your fork and the original source are now two separate entities. Suppose someone made a new commit on master to the original repository after you forked it: this commit won't be automatically available in your fork.</p>
        <img src="img/repo4.png" alt="Original repo with new commit" title="Original repo with new commit" />
        <p>When you want to update your local copy, importing new changes from the original repository, you need to run these commands from inside the repository (i.e. the <kbd>webpay</kbd> folder).</p>
		<pre>
# Important: the following line will delete every local change. It’s useful to
# avoid conflicts and merges, if you know what you’re doing you can ignore it
git stash

# Ensure that you’re on the branch called Master
git checkout master

# Pull changes from Mozilla’s repositories, merge to your repository and push
# changes to Github. We told Git what "upstream" is right after cloning
# the repository.
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
git push</pre>
        <p>Provide your GitHub’s credentials and the updates will be pushed to your GitHub’s repository.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> you could get this error the first time you try to push:</p>
            <pre>warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value is changing in
Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
and maintain the current behavior after the default changes, use:

  git config --global push.default matching

To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

  git config --global push.default simple</pre>
        <p>To fix it and adopt the new default behavior, simply run the last command from the command prompt (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13148066/warning-push-default-is-unset-its-implicit-value-is-changing-in-git-2-0">more details here</a>).</p>
        <pre>git config --global push.default simple</pre>
		<h2>Create a pull request to update your locale</h2>
		<p>As a first step you need to create a branch in your repository, so you’ll have to choose a name for it. For example let’s call this branch <kbd>jul29_it</kbd></p>
        <p>You should never commit changes to master, since it will create merge conflicts when trying to update against the original repository.</p>
		<pre>
# Create the branch
git branch jul29_it

# Ensure that you’re on the branch just created
git checkout jul29_it

# Push the new branch to your repository on GitHub
git push origin jul29_it</pre>
        <p>This is the result:</p>
        <img src="img/repo2.png" alt="New branch on fork" title="New branch on fork" />
		<p>At this point your local files are on the branch called <kbd>jul29_it</kbd>. You can always check the current branch or the files modified by running <kbd>git status</kbd>:</p>
        <pre>
On branch jul29_it
nothing to commit, working directory clean
        </pre>
        <p>Update the files and, when you’re ready, commit your changes using these commands. In this case I’m updating Italian and the file is <kbd>locale/it/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po</kbd> (side note: don’t commit .mo files, they’re compiled from .po and not necessary).</p>
		<pre>
# Add the updated file to the commit
git add locale/it/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po

# Commit with a meaningful message
git commit -m "Updated Italian localization"

# Push changes to GitHub
git push origin jul29_it</pre>
        <p>At this point your branch will be one commit ahead of master.</p>
        <img src="img/repo3.png" alt="New branch with commit" title="New branch with commit" />
		<p>Now you can go to your forked repository on GitHub and you will see something like this.</p>
        <img src="img/git2.png" alt="pr" title="Create pull request" />
		<p>Click on the button <strong>Compare &amp; pull request</strong>, check the pull request (you can see the diff at the bottom of the page) and if everything looks good click on the green button <strong>Send pull request</strong> to complete the procedure.
        <img src="img/git3.png" alt="pr" title="Create pull request" />
        You’ll receive an email when the pull request is merged into the project, or if there’s a problem with the pull request and someone added a comment. If necessary, you can modify or close your pull request from the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/webpay/pulls">project’s pull requests list</a> (select your pull request, the <kbd>Close</kbd> button is at the end of the screen).
        <img src="img/git4.png" alt="pr" title="Create pull request" />
        </p>

		<h2>Final suggestions</h2>
		<ul>
            <li>If something goes wrong, you can always delete your forked repository and start from scratch, or return to the branch Master (see Update section) and create a new clean branch to start from. As a personal suggestion, don’t ever commit to Master, just create new branches for your own changes.</li>
            <li>Always update your forked repository before creating new branches.</li>
            <li>If you create a pull request from the branch jul29_it and push other commits to the same branch, the pull request will be automatically updated. In other words: if you don’t want to change your original pull request, don’t push to that branch until the pull request is approved and merged.</li>
        </ul>
