		<h1>Basic Git for localizers</h1>

		<h2>Fork a repository</h2>
		<p>If you don't have an account on GitHub, register one for free on <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a> and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-all">install git</a> on your system.</p>
		<p>Once you login, go to the repository you're interested in and create a "fork".
		Let's say you want to create a fork of <kbd>webpay</kbd>: go to <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/webpay">github.com/mozilla/webpay</a> and click on the <strong>Fork</strong> button on the top right.<img src="img/git1.png" alt="fork" title="Fork the repository" /></p>
		<p>This will create a fork (think of it as a copy) of the <kbd>webpay</kbd> repository in your own account.</p>

		<h2>Clone your forked repository</h2>
		<p>Now you have to clone the repository on your computer. Suppose that your username is <kbd>l10nguy</kbd>, you need to clone <a href="https://github.com/l10nguy/webpay">https://github.com/l10nguy/webpay</a> and tell the system that you want to use the original Mozilla repository as a source for updates.</p>
        <p>These are the commands you need to run in your terminal (move into the folder where you want to keep your files before running them):</p>
		<pre>
# You're cloning your forked repository, so github.com/YOURUSER/REPOSITORY
git clone https://github.com/l10nguy/webpay

# You're telling Git to use another repository as a source
# So not YOURUSER but MOZILLA in this case
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mozilla/webpay</pre>

		<h2>Update your forked repository</h2>
		<p>Now you have a local copy of your fork inside the folder <kbd>webpay</kbd>. When you want to update your local copy you need to run these commands from inside the repository (i.e. the <kbd>webpay</kbd> folder).</p>
		<pre>
# Important: the follow line will delete every local change. It's useful to
# avoid conflicts and merges, if you know what you're doing you can ignore it
git stash

# Ensure that you're on the branch called Master
git checkout master

# Pull changes from Mozilla's repositories, merge to your repository and push
# changes to Github
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
git push</pre>
        <p>Provide your GitHub's credentials and the updates will be pushed to your GitHub's repository.</p>

		<h2>Create a pull request to update your locale</h2>
		<p>As a first step you need to create a branch in your repository, so you have to choose a name. For example let's call this branch <kbd>jul29_it</kbd></p>
		<pre>
# Create the branch
git branch jul29_it

# Ensure that you're on the branch just created
git checkout jul29_it

# Push the new branch to your repository on GitHub
git push origin jul29_it</pre>
		<p>At this point your local files are on the branch called <kbd>jul29_it</kbd> (you can always check the current branch or the files modified by running <kbd>git status</kbd>). Update the .po files and when you're ready commit your changes using these commands. In this case I'm updating Italian and the file is <kbd>locale/it/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po</kbd> (don't commit .mo files, they're compiled from .po and not necessary).</p>
		<pre>
# Add the updated file to the commit
git add locale/it/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po

# Commit with a meaningful message
git commit -m "Updated Italian localization"

# Push changes to GitHub
git push</pre>
		<p>Now you can go to your forked repository on GitHub and you will see something like this.</p>
        <img src="img/git2.png" alt="pr" title="Create pull request" />
		<p>Click on the button <strong>Compare &amp; pull request</strong>, check the pull request (you can see the diff on the bottom of the page) and if everything looks good click on the green button <strong>Send pull request</strong> to complete the procedure.
        <img src="img/git3.png" alt="pr" title="Create pull request" />
        You'll receive an email when the pull request is merged into the project, or if there's a problem with the pull request and someone added a comment. If necessary, you can modify or close your pull request from the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/webpay/pulls">project's pull requests list</a> (select your pull request, the <kbd>Close</kbd> button is at the end of the screen).
        <img src="img/git4.png" alt="pr" title="Create pull request" />
        </p>

		<h2>Final suggestions</h2>
		<ul>
            <li>If something goes wrong, you can always delete your forked repository and start from scratch, or return to the branch Master (see Update section) and create a new clean branch to start from. As a personal suggestion, don't ever commit to Master, just create new branches for your own changes.</li>
            <li>Always update your forked repository before creating new branches.</li>
            <li>If you create a pull request from the branch jul29_it and push other commits to the same branch, the pull request will be automatically updated. In other words: if you don't want to change your original pull request, don't push to that branch until the pull request is approved and merged.</li>
        </ul>
